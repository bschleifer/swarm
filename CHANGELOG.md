## [2026.4.17.2] - 2026-04-17

### Features
- **Dashboard "Awaiting your input" pill on worker tiles.** When a worker sits in WAITING state past a 15-second grace window, the tile now shows a pulsing amber pill to make operator-action-required cases visually distinct from a plain WAITING badge. Drives off a new `Worker.needs_operator_input` property exposed via the workers API. Fixes the common confusion where a worker presenting an `AskUserQuestion` prompt looked indistinguishable from a stalled/silent worker.

### Fixes
- **Cross-project task attribution on MCP `swarm_create_task`.** When a worker called `swarm_create_task` with `target_worker=X`, the resulting task row landed in the DB with `source_worker=""` — the calling worker's identity was lost. The handler now calls `edit_task` to record `source_worker` (the calling worker) alongside `target_worker` before assigning, so `is_cross_project` lineage is preserved end-to-end. Self-targeted tasks skip the edit to avoid spurious cross-project flags.

## [2026.4.17] - 2026-04-17

### Features
- **`swarm_batch` MCP tool** — ninth coordination tool; runs multiple `swarm_*` ops sequentially in one round-trip so a worker no longer pays N round-trips for N related calls. Nested `swarm_batch` is rejected to prevent runaway recursion. Each op is still buzz-logged individually.
- **Richer MCP tool descriptions** — every `swarm_*` tool now carries a ≥150-char description with trigger hints ("when to call"), enum semantics (e.g. `finding` vs `warning` vs `dependency` vs `status`), and concrete `examples` in the input schema.
- **`swarm analyze-tools` CLI** — aggregates MCP tool usage from the buzz log (`mcp:*` entries) into per-tool stats: calls, errors, active workers, and up to five distinct error snippets per tool. Supports `--since=7d`, `--json` output, and `--db PATH` for offline DB analysis.
- **Approval-rate gauge** — `SystemLog.approval_rate(since=...)` returns `{approvals, escalations, rate}` from recent decisions; new `GET /api/drones/approval-rate?hours=N` endpoint; dashboard header badge shows the percentage over the last 24h.
- **`DroneDecision.confidence`** — optional float field so future LLM-classifier rules can slot in next to the existing rule-based decisions without a schema change.
- **Compact event telemetry** — every `/compact` logs a `SystemAction.COMPACT` entry under new `LogCategory.COMPACT` with `{tokens_before, tokens_after, ratio, trigger}` metadata. Makes compaction effectiveness measurable per worker and per run.
- **Cron-format pipeline schedules** — pipeline steps now accept full 5-field cron expressions (e.g. `"30 14 * * 1-5"` for weekdays at 14:30). Legacy `HH:MM`, `*:MM`, and `HH:*` still work and are translated to cron internally. Adds `croniter` as a dependency.
- **Skills registry** — SQLite-backed skills table (schema v5 migration, idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`). `SkillsStore` CRUD + usage counters; `attach_skills_store()` seeds built-in defaults (`/fix-and-ship`, `/feature`, `/verify`) on first boot. New `GET /api/skills` endpoint. `get_skill_command()` consults the registry before falling back to the in-memory map and increments `usage_count` on each lookup.
- **`claude_code_security` service handler** — new pipeline AUTOMATED step that runs `claude code security scan --json`, parses the findings array, maps severity to Swarm task priority (`critical→urgent`, `high→high`, `medium→normal`, `low/info→low`), and deduplicates against a persistent state file fingerprinted by `sha256(rule_id\x00path\x00line)`. Supports `severity_filter`, configurable command, and custom dedup state path.
- **Test harness infra pinning** — every `swarm test` run captures an `InfraSnapshot` (model, provider, worker_count, port, claude_home, swarm_version, python_version, platform, env_hash, env_keys) and writes it as the first line of `test-run-{id}.jsonl`. The Markdown report gains an "Infrastructure Snapshot" section above the summary. New `swarm test --pin-model=<id>` flag records the model identifier explicitly, and `compute_env_hash` fingerprints tracked env vars (CLAUDE_MODEL, SWARM_PROVIDER, etc.) via SHA-256 so infra drift is debuggable without leaking secrets.
- **Opt-in Claude Code sandbox** — new `sandbox:` config block on `HiveConfig` (`{enabled, min_claude_version, settings_overrides}`). When enabled, `hooks.install.install()` calls `claude --version`, verifies the installed CC version meets `min_claude_version`, and merges `settings_overrides` into `~/.claude/settings.json["sandbox"]`. Unsupported or missing versions silently stay on the legacy approval flow. Disabled by default; no behaviour change for existing installs.
- **In-app feedback** — report bugs, feature requests, and questions directly from the dashboard footer. Submissions go through the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to bypass URL length limits, with a preview-and-edit step before the issue is filed. Sensitive paths and config values are auto-redacted.
- **Resource monitoring** — memory, swap, and load tracked on a 30s tick; workers auto-suspend on HIGH pressure and the operator is paged on CRITICAL. D-state (wedged process) scanning is optional.
- **Jira integration** — two-way sync with Jira Cloud over OAuth 2.0 (3LO). Import issues as tasks, push status and completion comments back, create Jira issues from the task board.
- **Email integration** — Microsoft Graph (Outlook) integration: drop `.eml`/`.msg` onto the task board, fetch emails from the dashboard, and draft a reply in the Drafts folder when a task completes (never auto-sent).
- **MCP server** — HTTP-based MCP server at `/mcp` (Streamable HTTP + legacy SSE). Workers get 9 coordination tools: `swarm_check_messages`, `swarm_send_message`, `swarm_task_status`, `swarm_create_task`, `swarm_complete_task`, `swarm_report_progress`, `swarm_claim_file`, `swarm_get_learnings`, `swarm_batch`.
- **Inter-worker messages** — typed messages (finding, warning, dependency, status, operator) delivered via MCP; dedup + rate-limit per `(sender, recipient, type)` pair.
- **Pipelines** — multi-step workflows combining AGENT, AUTOMATED, and HUMAN steps with per-step dependencies, templates, and start/pause/resume lifecycle. State persisted in SQLite.
- **Queen oversight** — proactive monitoring: prolonged-buzzing detection and task-drift analysis; interventions classified by severity (minor note, pause+redirect, escalate to operator).
- **File ownership & coordination** — single-branch mode (default) with Queen-managed file ownership map; warning or hard-block on overlap; worktree escape hatch when scopes are unavoidable.
- **Auto-pull sync** — workers auto-pull when another worker commits on the shared branch.
- **Multi-provider support** — Claude Code (production), Gemini CLI and Codex CLI (experimental), plus custom providers via `custom_llms` and per-provider overrides.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — one-click remote HTTPS access from the dashboard toolbar; optional named-domain configuration via `tunnel_domain`.
- **Dashboard push notifications** — browser push + desktop notifications + terminal bell; persistent Buzz Log history.
- **Interactive terminal attach** — full xterm.js PTY bridge over WebSocket, up to 20 concurrent sessions.
- **PWA** — installable app with service-worker offline shell and badge API for pending proposals.
- **Config editor in the dashboard** — tabbed UI for workers, groups, drones, Queen, workflows, and integrations; changes apply immediately.
- **Drone log & tuning analytics** — per-rule hit stats and AI-suggested approval rule patterns.
- **Speculation (experimental)** — preparatory read-only work on a queued task while a worker is RESTING.
- **Swarm CLI: `swarm db`** — `stats`, `export`, `prune`, `backup`, `check` for inspecting and maintaining the unified SQLite store.
- **Swarm CLI: `swarm test`** — supervised end-to-end orchestration test against a dedicated port with an AI-generated report.
- **Claude Code hook integration** — PreToolUse (drone-based approval), SessionEnd (immediate STUNG detection), and event hooks (SubagentStart/Stop, PreCompact/PostCompact) installed automatically by `swarm init`.

### Changes
- **Unified SQLite storage** — tasks, task history, proposals, messages, pipelines, buzz log, queen sessions, secrets, and config itself all live in `~/.swarm/swarm.db` (WAL mode). The legacy YAML is treated as a seed/import format; the database is the runtime source of truth after first run.
- **Jira auth is OAuth-only** — token auth was removed in favor of Atlassian OAuth 2.0 (3LO).
- **Config mutations are immediate** — dashboard edits write straight to the DB and hot-apply in the same request.
- **Calendar versioning** — version now tracks release date (`YYYY.M.D.patch`) rather than semver; the v1.0.0 section below is preserved for history.

### Fixes
- Numerous fixes to feedback submission (live `HiveConfig` serialization, `gh` CLI fallback for 8 KB URL limits, preview/edit gate before submission).
- See `git log` for the full per-commit history.
